# ------------------------------------------------

#This program is a "racing game" which the user can access with a password.
#Upon being granted access, the user is given the choice of playing Manual
#mode or Automatic mode. Manual features two racers against each other,
#while Automatic pits four in an automatic free-for-all race.
#The program pulls its racer names and numbers from the pycar.txt file
#and writes its respective winners in the pyraceresults.txt file.
#Once the race finishes, it will ask the user if they wish to race again.

#First we import the random function to be used in the race functions.
#We also name variables which will define the parameters of our races.
#Note that there are two different maximums numbers of racers. This is because
#each variable is for a different game mode.
